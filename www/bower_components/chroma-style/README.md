## chromastrap

There are 2 parts to our styling system. First, a bootstrap theme in the form of re-defined stylus vars. Second, further styling that extends bootstrap.

If you want to merely customize the flavor of chroma.fund with a customized bootstrap theme, edit `style/custom.bootstrap.import.styl` to taste.

Chromastrap extends bootstrap to support the specifics of each site. It also create 2 sub-schemes- the default and "inverse" scheme. This is differentiated by the class of "inverse." Chroma's stylying is dark by default.
